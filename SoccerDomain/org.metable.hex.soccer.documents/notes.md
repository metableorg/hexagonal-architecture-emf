The "soccer universe" can be structured as a hierarchical system with various organizations, leagues, teams, and players occupying different levels of the hierarchy. Here is a possible example of how this hierarchy could be structured:

* Global governing bodies: At the top of the hierarchy are global governing bodies such as FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) and UEFA (Union of European Football Associations). These organizations are responsible for regulating the sport of soccer and organizing international competitions such as the World Cup and the UEFA Champions League.


* National and regional governing bodies: Below the global governing bodies are national and regional governing bodies such as the English Premier League (EPL) and the Spanish La Liga. These organizations oversee professional soccer leagues within their respective countries and regions.


* Soccer clubs: At the next level are soccer clubs that participate in professional leagues. These clubs can be either privately owned or publicly owned, and they compete against each other in various competitions such as league matches, cup competitions, and international tournaments.


* Coaches and managers: Coaches and managers are responsible for leading and managing soccer clubs. They develop game strategies, train players, and make tactical decisions during matches.


* Players: At the lowest level of the hierarchy are the players themselves. They are the primary performers in the sport of soccer and are responsible for executing game strategies and scoring goals during matches.


Overall, this hierarchical structure reflects the complex and interconnected nature of the soccer universe, with various organizations and individuals playing critical roles in the development and success of the sport.
